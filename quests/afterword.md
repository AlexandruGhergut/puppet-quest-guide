# Afterword

Thank you for embarking on the journey to learn Puppet. We hope that the
Learning VM and the Quest Guide helped you get started on this journey. 

We had a lot of fun writing this guide, and hope it was fun to read and use as
well. This is just the beginning for us, too. We want to make the Learning VM the
best possible first step in a beginner's journey to learning Puppet. With time,
we will add more quests covering more concepts. 

If you are interested in learning more about Puppet, please visit the [Puppet
Labs Workshop](https://puppetlabs.com/learn).
