## The Learning Virtual Machine (VM)

If you want to learn more about Puppet or are a new user of Puppet or just looking to have fun exploring Puppet, then you've come to the right place. This is our free downloadable Learning VM for you to play around with and explore. The Learning VM is a companion to our Puppet Quests, which are a series of tutorials about the Puppet language and using its various tools. Although, please keep in mind that this Learning VM focuses on using Puppet Enterprise at its core, but most of the quests can also apply to Puppet open source.

## Learning Puppet

So what is Puppet? Great question! Puppet is a versatile tool for managing your servers. You simply describe your machine configurations in an easy-to-read declarative language (such as Ruby), and Puppet will ensure that your systems conform to and stay in that desired state.

Associated with this Learning VM are a series of quest adventures that will teach you about about managing your systems with Puppet. These quests start out very basic to accommodate all users no matter your experience level. Essentially, we provide everyone a level starting point to build from. From there, its up to you how much you want to learn and what exactly you want to learn. We hope that this will be the beginning of an interesting journey towards automating your systems management efforts.

## The Quest Structure

The individual quest design is very simple in its structure and consists primarily of three parts.

1. An introduction to the quest as it relates to Puppet
2. A themed storyline of the quest and how Puppet fits in.
3. Going on your quest adventure! (Applying what your knowledge in the Learning VM!)
