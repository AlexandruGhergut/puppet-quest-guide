# Welcome to Elvium

In this quest you will be introduced to Elvium, the Learning Virtual Machine environment.

## Welcome to Elvium

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

> -Arthur C. Clarke

Welcome to Elvium, user. Have a look around. Walk down a directory path and admire our landscape.

<!--
We'll need to have a few interesting files and directory structures already in place.
-->

Wander the verdant forests of files and hear the clamor of bustling services. But take note: what you see now is only the surface. The real channels of power in Elvium lie deeper, in the very bones of the kingdom, and you must learn of these things. You see, you are not an ordinary user, for you have been born into the Elvium with a user id of '0', the fabled mark of the **Superuser**.

In recognition of this auspicious sign, the venerable council of Sudoers has seen fit to present you with this Quest Guide.

If you choose to follow the path set forth herein, you will learn to channel your abilities by using the art of Puppet. With only a few words, slay nefarious daemons, raise armies of users, orchestrate magnificent services, and, most importantly, weave your power into abiding enchantments to ensure that your will continues to be done in Elvium as you journey out to bring other kingdoms into your dominion.

## Tasks

Your arrival has been foretold, user, and we have made the necessary preparations. You need not worry now about the details; you will learn soon enough. You need only speak a few words of power to set the prophesy in motion.

1. Type the following command and be FTP'd to Elvium:

		puppet apply -e bootstrap

	CALL OUT: The power of Puppet is immense. With one command you will set up your entire enviornment created locally


2. Just in case you ever get stuck, we on Elvium have provided you an unlimited supply of help. To learn more about the help we provide, type the following command:

		puppet help
		
3. You are a curious being. Would you like to further investigate Elvium? To do this on Elvium we use the tool `facter` to excute investigatory commands. Here are a few for you to try out

		facter ipaddress
		facter facterversion
		facter memorysize
		facter operatingsystem
		facter osfamily
		facter puppetversion

	CALL OUT: You can see all `facter` commands [here](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/latest/core_facts.html)

4. Carthik - at this point I would go over key commands for navigating the LVM such as `progress`, `completedtasks`, `questtasks`, etc. (those are not literal examples). Don't worry about the intro.md file. It will be going away. I will be updating the Quest Map to relect this
