# Afterword

Thank you for embarking on the journey to learn Puppet. We hope that the Learning VM and the Quest Guide helped you get started on this journey. 

We had a lot of fun writing the guide, and hope it was fun to read and use as well. This is just the beginning for us, too. We want to make Learning VM the best possible first step in a beginner's journey to learning Puppet. With time, we will add more quests covering more concepts. 

If you are interested in learning more about Puppet, please visit the [Puppet Labs Workshop](https://puppetlabs.com/learn).

To get started with Puppet Enterprise [download it for free](http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pe.html).

Please let us know about your experience with the Learning VM. 

Please report issues at the [Learning VM issue tracker](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/LEARNVM).  

You can also reach us at [learningvm@puppetlabs.com](mailto:learningvm@puppetlabs.com). We look forward to hearing from you.
