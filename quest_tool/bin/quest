# Run with "update" to update quest content.
# Run with "resetlocks" for emergency cleanup.  The updatecache argument
# is to just force an update of the caches, namely to be run from bash's
# PROMPT_COMMAND so that tmux can just use the caches instead of wasting
# cpu on running a command over and over that can only change when the
# user runs a command anyway.
