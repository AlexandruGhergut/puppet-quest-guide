## Download the Learning Puppet Enterprise Virtual Machine

### It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.

Start on your quest for Puppet mastery with the right equipment. Download the Learning Puppet Enterprise VM and step into (ok, well maybe SSH into) a virtual environment stocked with everything you'll need for a Puppet adventure. 

The VM comes with an installation of Puppet Enterprise as well as a Quest Guide that will be your companion as you learn the Puppet Enterprise Console, get your hands dirty with Puppet code, visit the Puppet Forge, and learn to craft your very own Puppet modules.

If you're not familiar with virtual machines or virtualization software, don't worry; we've included detailed setup instructions for VMWare and VirtualBox when you download the VM. Follow the setup guide, and you'll have a learning environment configured in minutes.

(And for our more advanced users: feel free to fold, spindle, or mutilate. You can always spin up a new VM when you want to get started with the Quest Guide.)
