## Download the Learning Puppet Enterprise Virtual Machine

### It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.

Start on your quest for Puppet mastery with the right equipment. Download the Learning Puppet Enterprise VM and step into (ok, well maybe SSH into) a virtual environment stocked with everything you'll need for a Puppet adventure. 

The VM comes with an installation of Puppet Enterprise as well as a Quest Guide that will be your companion as you learn Puppet architecture, get your hands dirty with Puppet code, visit the Puppet Forge, and learn to craft your very own Puppet modules.

If you're not familiar with virtual machines or virtualization software, don't worry; we've included detailed setup instructions with the VM downloads. Follow the setup guide, and you'll have a learning environment up in minutes.

(And for our more advanced users: feel free to fold, spindle, or mutilate. You can always spin up a new VM when you want to get started with the Quest Guide.)
