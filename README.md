# Courseware Learning VM

## Synopsis

The Learning VM (Virtual Machine) is a self contained learning environment.
It includes with everything a new user needs to get started learning Puppet.
The courses are in an extensible quest-based format to allow users to
explore and build on concepts at their own pace. 

The Learning VM is written with Puppet Enterprise (PE) in mind, and some of
the content is PE-specific. That being said, however, a user interested
in Puppet Open Source will likely find the content helpful as well.

Because the VM and Quest Guide are self contained, a user can learn
Puppet anywhere; after the initial download, no internet connection is
required.
