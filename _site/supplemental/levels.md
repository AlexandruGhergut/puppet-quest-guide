NOTE: We need a way to track all tasks completed by the user. Could we base this off the users unique system? This way no account registration is necessary

NOTE: The header of this chart "LEVEL" and "TASKS NEEDED" should be the same size and font as each rank listed below it.

NOTE: The "# of tasks" needed to reach each rank should be dynamic and able to fluctuate as we add more quests
