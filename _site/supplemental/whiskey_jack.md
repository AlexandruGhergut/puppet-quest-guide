Whiskey Jack is a mysterious fellow you see. You know, they say he put the salt in the sea. Crazy, I know, but that's what I hear. Anyways, Captain Whiskey Jack's previous ship, the OpsWave, parished at sea only after a few years of rough seas, but was the backbone to running Polly. I guess the ship wasn't strong enough to handle the ever changing environment, battle wounds, fires, and viruses that plagued the ship. It came to a point where he nor his crew could manage the OpsWave's repairs anymore and as a result Polly was going downhill. One night while the Captain was sleeping in his quarters, a rogue wave, in one gulp, swallowed the OpsWave and crew, sending them down to Davy Jones. Somehow though, the Captain managed to escape the depths of the sea. The only one ay. Legend has it, that he stuffed himself into an empty whiskey barrel and floated to the top ocean where he buoyed in the open water, no land in sight, for three nights, catching fish with his bare hands just to stay alive. That's how he got the name Whiskey Jack. The Captain will never say though. It's just pirate lore for now.
