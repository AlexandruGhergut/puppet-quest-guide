You my friend are working among the best and brightest pirates in all the lands  and with a legendary Captain too. Captain Whiskey Jack, being a fine business man and all, started a new age website called Polly. You see, it gives pirates like us the opportunity to sell our findings all over the world. Truly revolutionary ay! I should also mention anything can be auctioned on Polly. In turn, the Captain takes a small percentage of each sale for offering his service. Genius if you ask me! But as Polly continues to grow, the harder it is to maintain. The more ships that need to be managed. The more booty sold. That's why you're here, to make it simpler.
